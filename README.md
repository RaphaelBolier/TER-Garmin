The subject : 

Make a proof of concept of a Web plateform allowing to monitor physical activities / health values of elderly persons.
In this context, we will use a Garmin watch as a sensor to try to evaluate frequencies of specific (to elderly persons) movements.

The main objectif is to provide to family (sons, daughters, ...) an idea of the mobility and health of their elderly parent.
