In this context, we will use a Garmin watch as a sensor to try to
evaluate physical activities as for example frequencies of specific
(to elderly persons) movements :

* steps
* sit down movements
* get up movements
* outside walks
* ...

We will use watch too to collect medical and other forms of health
data :

* heart rate
* ...

The main objectif is to provide to family (sons, daughters, ...) an
idea of the mobility and health of their elderly parent.
